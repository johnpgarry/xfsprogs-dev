/*
 * Staging Cursors and Fake Roots for Btrees
 * =========================================
 *
 * A staging btree cursor is a special type of btree cursor that callers must
 * use to construct a new btree index using the btree bulk loader code.  The
 * bulk loading code uses the staging btree cursor to abstract the details of
 * initializing new btree blocks and filling them with records or key/ptr
 * pairs.  Regular btree operations (e.g. queries and modifications) are not
 * supported with staging cursors, and callers must not invoke them.
 *
 * Fake root structures contain all the information about a btree that is under
 * construction by the bulk loading code.  Staging btree cursors point to fake
 * root structures instead of the usual AG header or inode structure.
 *
 * Callers are expected to initialize a fake root structure and pass it into
 * the _stage_cursor function for a specific btree type.  When bulk loading is
 * complete, callers should call the _commit_staged_btree function for that
 * specific btree type to commit the new btree into the filesystem.
