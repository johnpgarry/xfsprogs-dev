.TH IOCTL-XFS-FSINUMBERS 2 2019-04-16 "XFS"
.SH NAME
ioctl_xfs_fsinumbers \- extract a list of valid inode numbers from an XFS filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B #include <xfs/xfs_fs.h>
.PP
.BI "int ioctl(int " fd ", XFS_IOC_FSINUMBERS, struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq *" arg );
.SH DESCRIPTION
Query a list of valid inode numbers from an XFS filesystem.
It is intended to be called iteratively to obtain the entire set of inodes.
These ioctls use
.B struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq
to set up a bulk transfer with the kernel:
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq {
	__u64   *lastip;
	__s32   count;
	void    *ubuffer;
	__s32   *ocount;
};
.fi
.in
.PP
.I lastip
points to a value that will receive the number of the "last inode".
Prior to the call, this value should be set to one less than the number of the
first inode for which the caller wants information.
After the call, this value will be set to the number of the last inode for
which information is supplied.
This field will not be updated if
.I ocount
is NULL.
.PP
.I count
is the number of inodes to examine.
.PP
.I ocount
points to a value that will receive the number of records returned.
An output value of zero means that there are no more inodes left to enumerate.
If this value is NULL, then neither
.I ocount
nor
.I lastip
will be updated.
.PP
.I ubuffer
points to a memory buffer where information will be copied.
This buffer must be an array of
.B struct xfs_inogrp
which is described below.
The array must have at least
.I count
elements.
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
struct xfs_inogrp {
	__u64   xi_startino;
	__s32   xi_alloccount;
	__u64   xi_allocmask;
}
.fi
.in
.PP
.I xi_startino
is the number of this inode numbers record.
Each inode numbers record will correspond roughly to a record in the inode
btree, though this is not guaranteed.
.PP
.I xi_alloccount
is the number of bits that are set in
.IR xi_allocmask .
.PP
.I xi_allocmask
is the mask of inodes that are in use for this inode.
The bitmask is 64 bits long, and the least significant bit corresponds to inode
.BR xi_startino .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.PP
.SH ERRORS
Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:
.TP
.B EFAULT
The kernel was not able to copy into the userspace buffer.
.TP
.B EFSBADCRC
Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the query.
.TP
.B EFSCORRUPTED
Metadata corruption was encountered while performing the query.
.TP
.B EINVAL
One of the arguments was not valid.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error was encountered while performing the query.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
There was insufficient memory to perform the query.
.SH CONFORMING TO
This API is specific to XFS filesystem on the Linux kernel.
