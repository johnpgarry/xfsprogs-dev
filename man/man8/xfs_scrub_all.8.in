.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xfs_scrub_all
[
.B \-hxV
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xfs_scrub_all
attempts to read and check all the metadata on all mounted XFS filesystems.
The online scrub is performed via the
.B xfs_scrub
tool, either by running it directly or by using systemd to start it
in a restricted fashion.
Mounted filesystems are mapped to physical storage devices so that scrub
operations can be run in parallel so long as no two scrubbers access
the same device simultaneously.
